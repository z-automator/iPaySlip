# Lending and Loan Management Component

This module handles the company's internal loan system, allowing employees to apply for, manage, and repay loans as part of the payroll ecosystem.

## Architecture Overview

- **Core Models**:
  - `LoanType`: Defines loan parameters like maximum amount and term
  - `Loan`: Main model for employee loan records with approval workflow
  - `LoanPayment`: Tracks individual repayments against loans

- **Key Views**:
  - Loan application and approval workflow
  - Loan repayment management
  - Loan type configuration
  - Integration with payroll system for automatic deductions

- **Templates**:
  - Loan application forms
  - Approval/rejection workflows
  - Payment history and tracking
  - Administrative interfaces for loan management

## Development Guidelines

1. **Loan Application Process**:
   - Employees can only apply for active loan types
   - Validate loan amount against maximum allowed by loan type
   - Validate term months against maximum allowed by loan type
   - Purpose field is required for all loan applications
   - Calculate monthly payment and total payable automatically

2. **Loan Workflow States**:
   - Pending → Approved → Active → Completed (or Cancelled)
   - Pending → Rejected (end state)
   - Status transitions should update appropriate date fields automatically
   - Approval requires appropriate permissions
   - Rejection requires a reason to be provided

3. **Loan Repayments**:
   - Manual and automatic repayment options
   - Track payment dates, amounts, and methods
   - Update loan remaining balance after each payment
   - Integrate with payroll system for automatic deductions
   - Validate that repayment doesn't exceed remaining balance

4. **Financial Calculations**:
   - Interest rate is always 0% (interest-free loans)
   - Monthly payment = total amount / term months
   - Total payable equals the loan amount (no interest)
   - Track paid amount and remaining balance
   - Handle edge cases like final payments that may be smaller

5. **Business Rules**:
   - Employee can't have multiple active loans of the same type
   - Loan approval requires manager/admin permission
   - Loan amount must be within the employee's eligibility
   - Repayment schedule should follow company policy
   - Loan completion should be properly recorded with actual end date

## Security Considerations

- All lending views require login
- Most operations require specific permissions
- Approval/rejection workflows have additional authorization checks
- Financial transaction data should be properly secured
- Audit trail maintained with timestamps and user tracking

## Testing Priority Areas

- Loan application validation rules
- Approval/rejection workflow
- Payment calculations and tracking
- Integration with payroll system
- Status transitions and date handling
