# Payroll Processing Component

This module handles all payroll-related functionality including salary calculation, deductions, tax handling, and payslip generation.

## Architecture Overview

- **Core Models**:
  - `Payroll`: Main model for employee payroll records
  - `PayrollEntry`: Individual entries (earnings/deductions) within a payroll
  - `PayrollPeriod`: Time periods for payroll processing
  - `Currency`: Currency management with exchange rates
  - `TaxTier`: Income tax brackets for calculations
  - `StandardPayrollItem`: Reusable payroll items (earnings/deductions)
  - `EmployeePayrollTemplate`: Templates for recurring payroll entries

- **Key Views**:
  - CRUD operations for all payroll-related entities
  - `PayrollProcessView`: Bulk payroll processing for multiple employees
  - PDF generation for payslips and reports
  - Tax calculation utilities

- **Templates**:
  - Bootstrap 5 form UI for payroll management
  - Detailed payroll views with entry breakdown
  - PDF templates for output documents

## Development Guidelines

1. **Payroll Processing Flow**:
   - Pay periods must be properly defined before processing
   - Validate employee data completeness before creating payrolls
   - Handle both monthly salary and hourly rate employees
   - Apply appropriate currency conversion using exchange rates

2. **Financial Calculations**:
   - Store both original currency and EGP values for reporting
   - Always convert Decimal to proper type before mathematical operations
   - Set default values for optional fields to avoid None/null calculations
   - Use utility functions in payroll/utils.py for tax calculations

3. **Payroll Entries**:
   - Basic salary/wages should always be the first entry
   - Categorize entries correctly as earnings or deductions
   - Update payroll totals after any entry modifications
   - Loan repayments should be handled automatically when present

4. **Templates and Payroll History**:
   - Use EmployeePayrollTemplate for faster payroll creation
   - Update templates after successful payroll processing
   - Handle exception when employee has no template
   - Maintain audit trail with created_at/updated_at timestamps

5. **PDF Generation**:
   - Use xhtml2pdf for Windows-compatible PDF generation
   - Follow standard payslip format in templates/payroll/pdf/
   - Include proper error handling for PDF generation failures
   - Apply consistent styling across all generated documents

## Security Considerations

- All payroll views require login
- Most operations require specific permissions
- Bulk operations require additional confirmation
- Sensitive financial data should be properly secured in transit and storage

## Testing Priority Areas

- Currency conversion and exchange rate handling
- Tax calculation with multiple brackets
- Loan repayment integration
- PDF generation with various data scenarios
- Payroll totals recalculation after entry modifications
