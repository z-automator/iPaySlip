# Payslip System POC Development

## Task Overview
Building a payroll system POC using Django that supports:
- Employee management
- Payroll processing
- Loan management with automatic deductions
- Payslip generation
- Role-based access control

## Tech Stack
- Django 4.2+
- SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- Django-allauth (authentication)
- Bootstrap 5 (UI)
- ReportLab/xhtml2pdf (PDF generation) - Replaced WeasyPrint due to Windows compatibility issues
- Celery (for scheduled tasks)

## Progress Tracking
[X] Create project plan
[X] Project setup with Django
[X] Core models implementation (Employee, Payroll, Loan)
[X] User interface development for employee management
[X] Lending module implementation
[X] Security and permissions
[X] PDF generation integration
[X] Payroll processing workflow implementation
[ ] Automated tasks setup
[ ] Testing and deployment setup

## Lessons
- Using Django for modern project structure
- Implementing role-based access control
- Tracking financial transactions with proper audit trails
- On Windows, use ReportLab or xhtml2pdf instead of WeasyPrint for easier setup and PDF generation
- For Django projects, always check dependencies compatibility with the target deployment OS
- When faced with dependency issues, look for alternative libraries that provide similar functionality
- Document any changes to project dependencies in requirements.txt
- Maintain consistency between model class names and their corresponding form class names
- Always ensure admin.py classes reference actual fields that exist in your models
- Use SQLite for development if there are issues with PostgreSQL setup
- When using django-allauth in development, set EMAIL_BACKEND to console backend and use 'optional' for ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION

## Scratchpad
### Current Step: Payroll Processing Workflow Implementation - COMPLETED
1. ✅ Update payroll URLs to include process payroll view
2. ✅ Create process_payroll.html template
3. ✅ Create payroll_list.html template
4. ✅ Create payroll_detail.html template
5. ✅ Create payroll_form.html template
6. ✅ Create payroll_confirm_delete.html template
7. ✅ Implement entry management views (add_payroll_entry, delete_payroll_entry)
8. ✅ Update payroll URLs to include entry management views

### Next Steps:
1. [ ] Implement automated tasks with Celery
    - [ ] Setup Celery configuration
    - [ ] Create recurring payroll processing task
    - [ ] Implement notification system for payroll approvals
    - [ ] Configure scheduled reports generation
2. [ ] Write tests for core functionality
    - [ ] Unit tests for models
    - [ ] Integration tests for payroll processing
    - [ ] UI tests for critical workflows
3. [ ] Set up deployment configuration
    - [ ] Configure production settings
    - [ ] Setup database migration scripts
    - [ ] Document deployment process
